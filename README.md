# CompilerProject
A compiler written in C++, following [this](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html) tutorial to create a compiler that can compile C

I learned a lot about how compiled languages are implemented while making this compiler.

### Features:
 - Integer type system
 - Functions
   - Local Variables
   - Scoped context
   - Loops
 - Global variables
 - Access to cstdlib

After making this compiler, I planned to make a general-purpose compiler, but maybe a interpreted language for easy development of graphics applications would be cool too

[See my Trello board for updates and new features](https://trello.com/b/TD2Sp6JF/compilerproject)

Update (2/3/2023): I am back from my hiatus on this project, so I should be pumping out a couple of features soon unguided by an explicit tutorial, although I may use a C-to-Assembly translator to help me with the implementation of certain features.
