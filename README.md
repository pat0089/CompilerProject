# CompilerProject
A compiler written in C++, following [this](https://norasandler.com/2017/11/29/Write-a-Compiler.html) tutorial to create a compiler that can compile C

I learned a lot about how compiled languages are implemented while making this compiler.

### Features:
 - Integer type system
 - Functions
   - Local Variables
   - Scoped context
   - Loops
 - Global variables
 - Access to cstdlib

After making this compiler, I planned to make a general-purpose compiler, but maybe a interpreted language for easy development of graphics applications would be cool too

[See my Trello board for updates and new features](https://trello.com/b/TD2Sp6JF/compilerproject)

Update (9/27/2022): I have finished the Nora Sandler compiler series and probably won't be making any significant updates to this project in the future, unless the great inspiration strikes me to do so.
